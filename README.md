## 🚀 How It Works

The project workflow consists of several key steps designed to deliver a comprehensive and actionable investment strategy:

1. **Data Upload & Preprocessing**  
   Users upload a `.csv` file containing financial data. The system processes the dataset by:

   - Validating and cleaning the data.
   - Normalizing features for better anomaly detection.
   - Handling missing or inconsistent values.

2. **Anomaly Detection & Analysis**  
   The model identifies irregularities in financial performance using anomaly detection techniques. Key insights include:

   - **Best Performance Period**: The timeframe with the highest returns.
   - **Worst Performance Period**: The timeframe with the lowest returns.
   - **Total Anomalies Detected**: The number of irregularities found in the data.

3. **Strategy Report Generation**  
   A detailed report is generated, including metrics such as:

   - Final investment value.
   - Strategy effectiveness score.
   - Recommended next steps for investors.  
     Users can download this report in a user-friendly format for further analysis.

4. **Interactive AI Chat**  
   Users can ask questions about the report in an integrated chat. The **Gemini model** ensures accurate and report-specific answers.

5. **Downloadable Strategy Results**  
   The system provides a downloadable file containing the calculated strategy results for offline reference.
